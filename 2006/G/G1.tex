\begin{problem}[ISL 2006 G1]
    Let $ABC$ be triangle with incenter $I$. A point $P$ in the interior of the
    triangle satisfies \[\angle PBA+\angle PCA = \angle PBC+\angle PCB.\]
    Show that $AP \geq AI$, and that equality holds if and only if $P=I$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[Ritwin]
    Some angle chasing yields that the condition is equivalent to
    $\angle BPC = 90\dg + \angle BAI$. Now consider the circumcircle of
    $\triangle BIC$, denote it $\omega$. We have $\angle BIC = 180\dg - \frac12\widehat{BC}$
    and some more angle chasing leads to $\angle BIC = 90\dg + \frac12 \angle BAC = 90\dg + \angle BAI$.
    
    Thus, we realize that for any $P$ inside $\omega$, $\angle BPC > 90\dg + \frac12 \angle BAC$,
    and the reverse inequality is true for $P$ outside $\omega$. So the locus
    of possible $P$ is arc $\widehat{BIC}$ (exclusive ends). All that remains
    is to prove that $A$, $I$, and $O$ are collinear. However this is a part of
    the Incenter-Excenter Lemma, so we are done. $\square$
