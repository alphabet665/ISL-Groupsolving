\begin{problem}[ISL 2005 N1]
    Determine all positive integers relatively prime to all the terms of the
    infinite sequence \[a_n=2^n+3^n+6^n-1, \quad n \geq 1.\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[Ritwin]
    We claim the only number is $1$. Call a prime $p$ \textit{good} if it is
    relatively prime to all $a_n$. We seek to show that no primes are good.
    
    To prove this, note that $a_2 = 48$ shows that neither $2$ nor $3$ is good.
    To finish, note that the following claim shows that no primes are good:
    
    \begin{claim*}
        $p \mid a_{p-2}$ for all primes $p > 3$
    \end{claim*}
    \begin{proof}
        We use Fermat's Little Theorem, and want to show that
        \[a_{p-2} = 6^{p-2} + 3^{p-2} + 2^{p-2} - 1 \equiv 6^{-1} + 3^{-1} + 2^{-1} - 1 \pmod p \tag{1}\]
        Since $p > 3$, note that $p \mid 6a_{p-2} \implies p \mid a_{p-2}$.
        Thus, we note that (1) shows \[6a_{p-2} \equiv 6 \cdot ((1 + 2^{-1})(1 + 3^{-1}) - 2) \equiv (2 + 1)(3 + 1) - 12 \equiv 0 \pmod p\] so we are done.
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
