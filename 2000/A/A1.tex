\begin{problem}[ISL 2000 A1]
    Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be positive real numbers so that $abc = 1$. Prove that
    \[\bigg(a-1+\frac1b\bigg) \bigg(b-1+\frac1c\bigg) \bigg(c-1+\frac1a\bigg) \leq 1.\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[Ritwin]
    Since $abc=1$, substitute
    \[(a, b, c) = \bigg(\frac xy, \frac yz, \frac zx\bigg)\]
    for positive $x$, $y$, $z$. We need to prove
    \[\prodcyc (x + y - z) \leq xyz.\]
    Expanding, the inequality is really just
    \[\sumsym x^2y \leq x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3xyz,\]
    which is the $r=1$ case of Schur's Inequality. $\square$
\end{solution}
