\begin{problem}[ISL 2017 C1]
    A rectangle $\mathcal{R}$ with odd integer side lengths is divided into
    small rectangles with integer side lengths. Prove that there is at least
    one among the small rectangles whose distances from the four sides of
    $\mathcal R$ are either all odd or all even.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}[Ritwin]
    Call a subrectangle \textit{good} if its distance from each of the four
    sides of $\mathcal R$ are either all odd or all even.
    
    Overlay onto the rectangle's grid squares a checkerboard, where each corner
    of $\mathcal R$ is black. Note that there is exactly one more black square
    than white squares.
    
    Note that if a subrectangle is good, it also has exactly one more black
    square than white. But note that if the subrectangle is not good, then it
    either has the same number of black and white squares, or it has exactly
    one more white square than black.
    
    This immediately proves that a good subrectangle must exist, as if it
    didn't, it is impossible to have one more black square than white. $\square$
\end{solution}
